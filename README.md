## Install

There are two common methods for installing this package.

### Through [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/)

Installing via [OpenUPM's command line tool](https://openupm.com/) is recommended because it supports dependency resolution, upgrading, and downgrading this package.

If you haven't already [installed OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html#installing-openupm-cli), you can do so through Node.js's `npm` (obviously have Node.js installed in your system first):
```
npm install -g openupm-cli
```
Then, to install this package, just run the following command at the root of your Unity project:
```
openupm add com.omiyagames.template
```

### Through [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html)

Unity's own Package Manager supports [importing packages through a URL to a Git repo](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html):

1. First, on this repository page, click the "Clone or download" button, and copy over this repository's HTTPS URL.  
2. Then click on the + button on the upper-left-hand corner of the Package Manager, select "Add package from git URL..." on the context menu, then paste this repo's URL!

While easier to follow than the first method, this one does not support dependency resolution and package upgrading when a new version is released.  So proceed with caution.
